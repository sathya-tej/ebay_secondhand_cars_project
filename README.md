# ebay_secondhand_cars_project
this is a small project i have done in my free time.

This project analyzes a dataset of over 370,000 used car listings from eBay Kleinanzeigen. The primary objective was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify the "most efficient" car options for buyers—defining efficiency in terms of value retention, durability (mileage vs. price), and market availability.
